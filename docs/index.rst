Project Background
==================
This project was build thanks to the contributions of the `ETH ZÃ¼rich <https://www.ethz.ch>`_ and the `Swiss Mooc Service <https://www.swissmooc.ch>`_ and it is currently build and maintained by `eduNEXT <https://edunext.co>`_.


Implementation notes
====================

* Uses the Open edX plugin architecture
* This plugin can be installed in versions of the project starting at the Hawthorn open release (Released in June 2018) and requires no modifications to the core source code of the edx-platform repository. Support for the Hawthorn version is guaranteed and it should as well work with newer versions.
